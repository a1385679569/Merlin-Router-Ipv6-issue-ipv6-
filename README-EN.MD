#Merlin-Route-Ipv6-Gateway-Issue
Some users who use Merlin firmware or ASUS routers often have some minor problems when bridging the optical modem with the router PPPOE dialing to obtain the IPV6 address. This is often manifested in the fact that in the ipv6-stateless mode, the ipv6 address and gateway can be obtained and assigned normally, but in the stateful mode The ipv6 gateway cannot be obtained. Based on this, the gateway command is automatically obtained when the computer is powered on. Method 1: Connect to the router with administrator rights (WEBSHELL, SCP, PUTTY, etc.). Type the command "ip -6 route add 0::/0 dev ppp0" "ip -6 route add default dev ppp0 metric 1" and press Enter. But it will fail every time you restart.
